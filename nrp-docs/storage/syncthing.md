# SyncThing

[SyncThing](https://syncthing.net) is a tool to synchronize collections of files between several devices with no single server, which creates a mesh between all devices and works well for large collections of files. We currently have it deployed on the Washington State node. You can request access to it by [contacting us](/contact).
