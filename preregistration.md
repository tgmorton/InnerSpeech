## Title

The Role of Physical Articulation in Inner Speech Monitoring

## Description

Speakers monitor their speech for errors before and during articulation, but the role of physical articulation in this monitoring process remains unclear. Slevc and Ferreira (2006) demonstrated that during overt speech production, speakers are sensitive to phonological—but not semantic—conflict when halting speech, suggesting that pre-articulatory monitoring prioritizes sound-level information. However, inner speech can occur without engaging the articulatory system, raising the question of whether phonological monitoring depends on articulatory engagement. The present study addresses this question by adapting Slevc and Ferreira's stop-signal picture naming paradigm for unmouthed inner speech. Participants silently name pictures and press a button to indicate speech onset, withholding their response when a non-matching distractor word appears. Distractor words vary in their phonological and semantic relatedness to the picture name (2×2 design), as well as their emotional valence (validation manipulation). If phonological monitoring persists without articulation, we expect to replicate the original phonological interference effect. Alternatively, if articulatory disengagement frees monitoring resources, semantic interference may emerge. A third possibility is that both forms of monitoring are attenuated when articulation is absent. The emotional valence manipulation provides a task validation check: replicating the valence effect from overt speech would confirm that button-press responses capture the same interference dynamics. Results will clarify how articulatory involvement shapes pre-speech monitoring and inform theories of inner speech and speech production.

## Hypotheses

**Semantic × Phonological Relatedness (Primary Manipulation)**

- **H1 (Replication):** Phonologically related distractors will reduce halting rates relative to unrelated distractors, with no effect of semantic relatedness. This would replicate Slevc and Ferreira (2006) and suggest phonological monitoring persists without articulation. (Directional)

- **H2 (Resource Reallocation):** Semantic relatedness will reduce halting rates, while phonological relatedness will show no effect. This would support a resource-based account in which disengaging articulation frees monitoring capacity for semantic processing. (Directional)

- **H0 (Null):** Neither phonological nor semantic relatedness will affect halting rates, suggesting that removing articulation eliminates pre-speech monitoring altogether.

**Emotional Valence (Task Validation)**

- **H1:** Emotionally valent distractors will increase halting success relative to neutral distractors, replicating Slevc and Ferreira (2006) and validating that button-press responses capture interference effects. (Directional)

- **H0:** No difference between emotional and neutral distractors.

- [ ] Other

## Blinding
- [ ] No blinding is involved in this study.
- [x] For studies that involve human subjects, they will not know the treatment group to which they have been assigned.
- [ ] Personnel who interact directly with the study subjects will not be aware of the assigned treatments (double blind).

## Study Design

The proposed study is a stop-signal picture naming study. Subjects are shown a fixation cross on a screen, then the cross is removed and replaced with the image of a concrete object. Subjects are asked to name the object as soon as possible, they are informed that on some trials, a written distractor word in red will be overlaid on the image, and that while preparing to name the image they should assess whether the distractor word written is the same as the image on the screen. This design follows from Slevc and Ferreira (2006), however it differs in that the picture is named with internal speech, without movement of the lips or tongue. In this case, participants are similarly tasked to name the object in their head, and are instructed to press a button when they begin naming the picture in their head.

If the word differs from the image on the screen, they should attempt to avoid naming the image, or stop naming the image as soon as possible. On some trials, no word appears overlaid on the image, in which case they are to continue naming the image as if a word the same as the displayed image appeared. These make up three trial types:

- **Go trials**: No word appears
- **Go-signal trials**: A matching distractor word appears
- **Stop-signal trials**: A non-matching word appears

Stop-signal distractor words are manipulated within-subjects 2 × 2 + 2 following from Slevc and Ferreira (2006). The 2 × 2 factors are semantic relatedness and phonological relatedness, where distractor words, for instance of a picture of an apple can be:

- Semantically and phonologically related (e.g., *apricot*)
- Semantically related but not phonologically related (e.g., *peach*)
- Phonologically related but not semantically related (e.g., *apathy*)
- Unrelated to the image (e.g., *couch*)

This follows from Experiment 1 and 2 of Slevc and Ferreira. The additional binary factor is from Experiment 5 of Slevc and Ferreira, where distractors are manipulated between emotionally valent words (e.g., *murder*) and length-matched emotionally neutral control words (e.g., *agreed*).

The same 18 pictures from Slevc and Ferreira are used, specifically the adapted pictures from Snodgrass & Vanderwart (1980) by Rossion & Portois (2004). The experiment consists of:

- **Practice section**: 72 practice trials
  - 27 go trials
  - 27 go-signal trials
  - 18 stop-signal trials (using unrelated distractor words)
- **Primary section**: 432 experimental trials
  - 162 go trials (37.5%, each picture nine times)
  - 162 go-signal trials (37.5%, each picture nine times)
  - 108 stop-signal trials (25%, six times each picture 2 × 2: 72, six times each picture +2: 36)

A 25% percentage of stop-signal trials ensures that participants are not anticipating stops in enough trials that it influences regular naming behavior. This design follows exactly from Experiment 5 of Slevc and Ferreira, including a fixed Stop Onset Asynchrony (SOA) of 200ms with no staircase procedure.

## Randomization

Trials are pseudorandomized such that more than 2 stop-signal trials never occur adjacent to each other. Participants are given three breaks, equally spaced.

## Existing Data

No existing data has been collected before the submission of this preregistration.

## Explanation of Existing Data

Not applicable.

## Data Collection Procedures

Participants will consist of university students from the University of California, San Diego. Participants must have normal to corrected-to-normal vision and be native speakers of English. Participants will be provided with SONA credit for their participation, which can be applied for class credit.

## Sample Size

48 participants.

## Sample Size Rationale

We replicate the sample size of 48 from Slevc and Ferreira (2006, Experiment 5). To justify this sample size, we conducted simulation-based power analyses using effect sizes and variance estimates derived from the original study. Across 1,000 simulations with 100% model convergence, a sample of 48 participants provides 96.1% power to detect the phonological similarity effect in the 2×2 design and 91.7% power to detect the emotional valence effect. This exceeds conventional thresholds (80%) for our primary effects of interest.

## Stopping Rule

N/A

## Manipulated Variables

- **Phonological relatedness** (within-subjects): Distractor words are either phonologically similar to the picture name (e.g., *apricot* for apple) or phonologically dissimilar.

- **Semantic relatedness** (within-subjects): Distractor words are either semantically similar to the picture name (e.g., *peach* for apple) or semantically dissimilar.

- **Emotional valence** (within-subjects): Distractor words are either emotionally valent (e.g., *murder*, *cancer*) or length-matched neutral controls (e.g., *agreed*, *miller*).

## Measured Variables

- Go RT
- Go-Signal RT
- Stop Trial Halt %
- Stop Trial non-stop RT

## Indices

Presence of Button Press and Button Press Reaction times are combined using the stop-signal race model into the derived measure of **stop-signal reaction time (SSRT)**.

## Statistical Models

We will use linear mixed-effects models with maximal random effects structure (Barr et al., 2013).

**2×2 Phonological × Semantic Relatedness:**
```
halt ~ phon * sem + (1 + phon + sem | subject) + (1 + phon + sem | item)
```

**Emotional Valence:**
```
halt ~ valence + (1 + valence | subject) + (1 + valence | item)
```

If maximal models fail to converge, we will iteratively simplify the random effects structure by removing correlations, then random slopes, starting with items.

## Transformations

Reaction time data will be log-transformed to reduce positive skew. Categorical predictors (phonological relatedness, semantic relatedness, emotional valence) will be sum-coded (−0.5, +0.5). Halting outcomes (binary) will be analyzed using logistic mixed-effects models.

## Inference Criteria

We will use α = .05 for all statistical tests. Effects will be evaluated using likelihood ratio tests comparing models with and without the effect of interest.

## Data Exclusion

- Participants who report a lack of inner voice will be excluded from the sample.
- Participants will be asked to report whether they experience visual imagery; as it is unknown what effect this may have on the task, we reserve the ability to exclude such participants from the sample and will explain the reasoning and analysis behind this decision if so.
- Participants with go-signal naming times outside of two standard deviations from the overall mean will be excluded.
- Participants who perform the task incorrectly will be excluded.

## Missing Data

We will collect replacement participants for our sample.

## Exploratory Analysis

N/A

## Other

This study is a conceptual replication and extension of Slevc and Ferreira (2006). The stop-signal paradigm follows Band et al. (2003) and Matzke et al. (2018). Picture stimuli are from Snodgrass and Vanderwart (1980) as adapted by Rossion and Pourtois (2004). The button-press methodology for inner speech draws from Dell (1978), who demonstrated equivalent error rates between overt and covert speech using this approach. The distinction between mouthed and unmouthed inner speech follows from Oppenheim and Dell (2010), who showed that articulatory engagement selectively affects phonological processing.
