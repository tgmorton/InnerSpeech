                     RESEARCH CONSENT


Victor Ferreira, who is a Professor at UC San Diego, is
conducting a research study to find out more about how
people produce language.

If you agree to be in this study, you will produce
language (i.e., talk) and respond to stimuli (i.e., press
buttons) when shown written or spoken words, sentences,
or pictures. One study session could include multiple
different specific tasks.

[... additional consent text ...]

Participation in research is entirely voluntary. You may
refuse to participate or withdraw at any time without
penalty or loss of benefits to which you are entitled.

                  PICTURE FAMILIARIZATION
                  ----------------------

First, you will see each picture with its name below it.

Please learn these names carefully, as you will use them
throughout the experiment.

   --------------------------------------------------------
   |  Take your time to memorize each picture and its     |
   |  name.                                               |

case, you should try to stop your naming response and
do nothing.
