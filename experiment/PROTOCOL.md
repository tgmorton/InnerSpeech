# Experimental Protocol: 26VF02

## RA Script

1. **Greet the participant** at the Language Production Lab door.
   - "Hi, are you here for study 26VF02?"
   - Confirm their name against the SONA sign-up list.

2. **Bring them into the testing room** and seat them in front of the computer. Before they sit down, give a brief overview:
   - "In this study, you'll see pictures appear on screen. Your job is to name each picture silently in your head and press the spacebar the moment you begin to recall the name of the object. On some trials, a word will appear on top of the picture in red — if the word is the same as the picture you're naming, you should not stop your response, if the word differs from the picture you're naming you should not name the picture in your head and should not press the spacebar. The computer will walk you through the full instructions."

3. **Explain the question policy:**
   - "You're welcome to knock on the door to ask questions at any point before or during the practice trials. Once the main experiment begins, we won't be able to answer questions, so make sure everything is clear during practice."

4. **Have the participant sit down** and begin reading the on-screen instructions. Close the door and wait outside.

5. **During practice:** Respond to any knocks. Confirm the participant understands the three trial types (Go, Go-signal, Stop-signal).

6. **After the experiment:** The IRQ questionnaire will appear on screen. Let the participant complete it, then debrief, thank them, and grant SONA credit.
